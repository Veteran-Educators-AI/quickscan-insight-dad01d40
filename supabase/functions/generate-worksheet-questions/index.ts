TOPICS:
${topicsList}

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
BLOOM'S TAXONOMY STRUCTURE (MANDATORY - Follow this progression):
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Each question MUST include a "bloomLevel" field (one of: remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, create) and a "bloomVerb" field with the specific action verb used.

LEVEL 1: REMEMBER (Recall facts and basic concepts)
├── Verbs: define, identify, list, name, recall, recognize, state, label
├── Question types: What is the formula for...? Identify the...? What are the...?
└── Example: "State the Pythagorean theorem." / "Identify which expression represents a quadratic function."

LEVEL 2: UNDERSTAND (Explain ideas or concepts)
├── Verbs: describe, explain, interpret, classify, summarize, compare, paraphrase
├── Question types: Explain why...? What does this mean...? Compare...
└── Example: "Explain why the sum of angles in a triangle equals 180°." / "Describe the relationship between the slope and y-intercept."

LEVEL 3: APPLY (Use information in new situations)
├── Verbs: solve, calculate, demonstrate, apply, compute, construct, use, implement
├── Question types: Calculate...? Solve for...? Apply the formula to find...
└── Example: "Calculate the area of a circle with radius 7 cm." / "Solve: 3x² - 12 = 0"

LEVEL 4: ANALYZE (Draw connections among ideas)
├── Verbs: analyze, differentiate, examine, compare, contrast, investigate, distinguish
├── Question types: Why does...? What evidence...? How does X relate to Y...?
└── Example: "Analyze why the function f(x) = x² has no x-intercepts when shifted up by 5 units." / "Examine the relationship between the discriminant and the nature of roots."

LEVEL 5: EVALUATE (Justify a decision or course of action)
├── Verbs: evaluate, justify, critique, assess, argue, defend, judge, support
├── Question types: Is this the best approach...? Justify your reasoning...? Which method is more efficient...?
└── Example: "Evaluate whether the substitution or elimination method is more efficient for this system." / "Justify why the triangle is a right triangle."

LEVEL 6: CREATE (Produce new or original work)
├── Verbs: design, construct, develop, formulate, create, devise, compose, plan
├── Question types: Design a...? Create an equation that...? Develop a strategy to...?
└── Example: "Create a quadratic equation that has roots at x = 3 and x = -5." / "Design a geometric proof to show that the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular."

BLOOM'S LEVEL FILTER (IMPORTANT):
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
${bloomInstruction}

DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
- For ${questionCount} questions, distribute ONLY across the allowed cognitive levels: ${allowedBloomLevels.join(', ')}
- If all 6 levels are allowed, use this distribution:
  • 10-15% Remember/Understand (foundation questions to build confidence)
  • 30-40% Apply (core computational and procedural skills)
  • 30-40% Analyze/Evaluate (higher-order thinking and reasoning)
  • 10-20% Create (synthesis and original thinking)
- If only specific levels are selected, distribute questions evenly across those levels
- Start with lower-level questions and progress to higher levels
- Each question should explicitly test the cognitive level indicated

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Generate exactly ${questionCount} questions total
2. Distribute questions across the topics (approximately ${questionsPerTopic} per topic)
3. EVERY question must include "bloomLevel" and "bloomVerb" fields
4. ONLY use cognitive levels from the allowed list: ${allowedBloomLevels.join(', ')}
5. Include multi-step problems that require showing work at Apply level and above
6. ${difficultyInstruction}
7. Use real-world contexts where appropriate (especially for Apply and above)
8. Questions should be clear and unambiguous${geometryInstruction}${formulasInstruction}${graphPaperInstruction}${coordinateGeometryInstruction}
${diagnosticInstruction}
${hintInstruction}
${formInstruction}
${variationInstruction}

CRITICAL - TEXTBOOK-QUALITY FORMATTING:
- Write in fluid, complete sentences like a professional textbook
- Use proper mathematical Unicode symbols throughout:
  • π instead of "pi" or "3.14"
  • √ for roots (√2, √3, √5)
  • ² ³ ⁴ ⁵ for exponents (x², y³, n⁴)
  • ° for degrees (30°, 45°, 90°, 180°)
  • ∠ for angles (∠ABC, ∠XYZ)
  • ≤ ≥ ≠ for inequalities
  • θ for angle theta
  • △ for triangles (△ABC ≅ △DEF)
  • ⊥ for perpendicular, ∥ for parallel
  • ≅ for congruent, ~ for similar
  • ½ ⅓ ¼ ⅔ ¾ for common fractions
- Format examples:
  ✓ "In △ABC, if ∠A = 45° and ∠B = 60°, find the measure of ∠C."
  ✓ "Find the area of a circle with radius r = 5 cm. Express your answer in terms of π."
  ✓ "Simplify: √48 + 3√12"
  ✓ "Solve for x: 2x² - 5x + 3 = 0"

Respond with a JSON array of questions in this exact format:
